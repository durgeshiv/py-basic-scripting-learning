# Is same as list in scala , can have AnyVal in type
lst=[1,2,'a',10.5]

#lets print all elements from list one by one
for elem in lst:
    print(elem)

## Set is also similar to that in Scala and follows above syntax

##Map or Dictionary - This is also same as in Scala with syntax as below:
empDict = {'Fname':'Durgesh', 'Lname':'Agnihotri'}

print(empDict['Fname'])
