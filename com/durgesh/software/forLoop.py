# Trying for-loop in python

# Lets create an array and print all elements of it using for loop

x = 'Lets try splitting this string using split function'.split(' ')

#starting for loop

for elem in x:
    print(elem)

#end of loop
# writing number of line in same indentation comes under the loop
# coming out of indentation will come out of loop
